    "text": "My BirdNET GitHub Repo\nThis week, I focused on data management, coding, and project organisation tasks. I received new data for the FoodBank project and began drafting a solutions report focused on cleaning and restructuring the current untidy Excel dataset to enhance its usability. I then concentrated on preprocessing and cleaning this dataset, setting the foundation for an updated dashboard.\nTo ensure the steps were reproducible, I used Google Colab and made a new repository in GitHub to upload the dashboard, cleaned data, and report. I also removed redundant notebooks from some of my Bird Net repository while consolidating the essential ones into a primary notebook and organising documentation-related files into a dedicated folder. I also developed an R program to retrieve area-specific data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) around Harper Adams University. I explored automating the conversion of human detections into a data file and submitted a request for eBird data to use in the Bird Net project to finish the confusion Matrix from the previous week."

    "text": "My BirdNET GitHub Repo\nThis week focused on finalising and refining visualisations and data management tasks. I completed the graphs for species confidence levels, highlighting the discrepancy between low and high-count species, with lower-count species generally showing lower confidence scores. Additionally, I created a heatmap and bar plots to visualise the frequency of calls and the average accuracy of predictions for various species. I organised the files and graphs, selecting only the most effective ones for the final version of the accuracy notebook. The data was also compiled into an Excel file with a data dictionary for clarity.\nI read Hadley Wickham’s “Tidy Data” paper, which provided valuable insights into organising data for analysis. I also made further improvements to my GitHub Pages blog, making it more informative and professional while also updating the README files across my projects to enhance their clarity and professionalism."

    "text": "My BirdNET GitHub Repo\nThis week, I focused on the Bird Net project, familiarising myself with its libraries and output data using Google Colab. I referred to the official GitHub page to better understand Bird Net’s functionalities and their application in my work. I received the first audio recordings for analysis and wrote a script in Google Colab to test the run times of processing these files through the Bird Net framework. To evaluate the processing efficiency, I created box plots that illustrated the run times across various files, with each file being processed three times. This allowed me to compare how run times varied with multiple runs of the same file.\nTo further analyse the data, I conducted an ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to determine if there was a significant difference in the processing times of the audio files. The results indicated no significant difference, suggesting that Bird Net’s processing time was consistent across different files. I also consolidated all CSV data from the transects into a single file, ensuring consistency in format and columns. This week enhanced my understanding of Bird Net’s processing and data analysis capabilities. Working in Google Colab also helped me create documented reproducible code."

    "text": "Dashboard progress 1\nHAU Community Fridge GitHub Repo\nThis week began with a briefing on a new task: conducting data analysis on a dataset of food saved by the community fridge and creating a dashboard highlighting the fridge’s impact on reducing food waste. I created a GitHub repository to manage the Food Waste Data, ensuring that all project files were organised and accessible.\nI used RStudio for the first time for data analysis and visualisation, which allowed me to apply my existing data analysis skills while also learning new techniques in R. The visualisations generated during this process formed the foundation of the dashboard I was tasked with creating.\nI planned the structure of the dashboard, selecting key metrics and choosing the best display methods to ensure information was conveyed clearly to viewers. Drafting the dashboard in RStudio using Quarto involved experimenting with different layouts and designs to balance informativeness and visual appeal.\nTowards the end of the week, we held a check-up meeting with the employer and university supervisors to discuss my progress. This meeting helped align our goals, gather feedback, and ensure everyone was informed about the project’s objectives and timeline. Overall, this week centred on learning R and laying the groundwork for a functional and informative dashboard."

    "text": "Food Bank Video Creator GitHub Repo\nTime Lapse Video\nThe first week of my placement focused on getting acquainted with my colleagues and attending a meeting to discuss an initial smaller project to test my knowledge and skills. This project was centred around a communal food fridge initiative to reduce food waste by collecting donations from local supermarkets. My main task for this project was to develop a Python script to process a series of images, automatically captured by a setup camera, into a time-lapse video. This video would allow viewers to observe how the food in the fridge was interacted with over time.\nIn addition to the image processing task, I also created a QR code using Python, which linked to the community fridge’s website. This task provided a practical application of the programming knowledge I had acquired during my coursework. Furthermore, I set up a GitHub repository for the project, where I created a README file. This experience with GitHub was a first and deepened my understanding of the importance of documentation and version control in real-world projects.\nI also learned to use DaVinci Resolve to edit the time-lapse video, a new experience that helped enhance my multimedia skills. Additionally, planning the content and structure of the video required creativity and project management. Overall, this first week allowed me to apply technical and soft skills in a real-world context, laying a foundation for the tasks and challenges I would encounter in the following weeks."

I carefully selected and implemented visualisations to display information, such as the total number of food items saved, daily averages, and the distribution of food categories. These enhancements ensured that the dashboard communicated the impact of the community fridge to viewers.\nOnce the visualisations were completed, I finalised the dashboard and ensured it was polished and ready for use. I also created a comprehensive README file for the dashboard repository using Markdown. This documentation ensured that others could easily understand and maintain the dashboard in the future.\nTowards the end of the week, I had an introductory meeting about the main project, Bird Net, an open-source machine-learning framework designed to analyse audio recordings and identify bird species based on their calls. This discussion provided an overview of the project and set the stage for upcoming tasks, such as preparing and analysing audio data to support conservation efforts.\nOverall, this week marked the successful completion of the dashboard and laid the groundwork for the future Bird Net project. The transition from one project to another highlighted the importance of adaptability and continuous learning in a professional environment."

    "text": "My BirdNET GitHub Repo\nThis week, I enhanced the analysis of bird species predictions by creating a diagnostic histogram to visualise the distribution of confidence scores. The histogram revealed a high count of detections with confidence scores ranging from 0.25 to 1.00, highlighting areas for potential improvement. I also analysed the top and bottom three bird species observed with over 20 detections to determine whether common birds had higher detection accuracy than rarer ones. This analysis included calculating average confidence scores and performing ANOVA and Pearson correlation analyses to explore the relationship between detection frequency and confidence scores.\nAdditionally, I converted my weekly blog notes into a more accessible format using Quarto in RStudio for uploading to GitHub Pages. I attended meetings and conferences to network, stay updated on developments, and receive feedback. I also examined the likelihood of rare bird detections being false positives by analysing confidence scores and recommended an accuracy cut-off in a two-page report.\nLastly, I calculated the average species richness, finding approximately 72 unique species per day, and suggested consistent measurements over time to better assess biodiversity trends."

    "text": "My BirdNET GitHub Repo\nThis week, I focused on several tasks related to the Bird Net project. I created a README file and added Google Colab links to improve the project’s usability and documentation. Additionally, I attempted to calculate the total number of detections by counting up each 3-second segment to identify how many detections were excluded due to confidence cut-offs. However, this proved challenging as multiple detections were often recorded within a single 3-second segment, complicating accurate calculations.\nUsing a confusion matrix, I also began drafting a comparison between AI predictions and human observations. This involved counting true positives, false positives, and false negatives. To begin completing the confusion matrix, I started exploring the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) as a potential source to obtain the true negatives. I then experimented with different confidence cut-offs for the AI predictions, finding that higher confidence thresholds led to fewer false positives and reduced the number of true positives. Meanwhile, lower confidence cut-offs led to the opposite, with more false positives and true positives. This highlighted the trade-off between precision and recall."
