[My BirdNET GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Jamess200/MyBirdNetTest)
```{python}
```

This week, I focused on the Bird Net project, familiarising myself with its libraries and output data using Google Colab. I referred to the official GitHub page to better understand Bird Net's functionalities and their application in my work. I received the first audio recordings for analysis and wrote a script in Google Colab to test the run times of processing these files through the Bird Net framework. To evaluate the processing efficiency, I created box plots that illustrated the run times across various files, with each file being processed three times. This allowed me to compare how run times varied with multiple runs of the same file.

To further analyse the data, I conducted an ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to determine if there was a significant difference in the processing times of the audio files. The results indicated no significant difference, suggesting that Bird Netâ€™s processing time was consistent across different files. I also consolidated all CSV data from the transects into a single file, ensuring consistency in format and columns. This week enhanced my understanding of Bird Net's processing and data analysis capabilities. Working in Google Colab also helped me create documented reproducible code.
