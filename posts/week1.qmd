The first week focused on getting acquainted with my colleagues and having an initial meeting to discuss my project. This initial project centred around a communal food fridge aimed at saving food waste from local supermarkets through donations. My task was to create a Python script that could process a series of images, automatically collected by a setup camera, into a time-lapse video, allowing viewers to see how the food was interacted with over time. Additionally, I learned how to create a QR code using Python that linked to the community fridge website, providing a practical application of the programming knowledge I gained during my coursework.

Setting up a GitHub repository and creating a comprehensive README file furthered my understanding of the importance of documentation and version control in real-world projects. Using DaVinci Resolve to edit the video was also a new experience that enhanced my multimedia skills. Planning the video content and structure required creativity and project management, adding to the breadth of skills I developed. Overall, this week effectively blended technical and soft skills development, laying a solid foundation for the tasks ahead.
