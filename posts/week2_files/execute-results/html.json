For this task, I created a GitHub repository to manage the Food Waste Data and used RStudio for the first time to perform the initial analysis and visualisations. This allowed me to apply my data analysis skills and learn new techniques in R, with the visualisations forming the foundation of the dashboard.\n\nI planned the dashboard's structure, selecting key metrics and deciding on the best display methods to convey the information effectively. Drafting the dashboard with Quarto in RStudio involved experimenting with different layouts to ensure it was informative and visually appealing. Towards the end of the week, we had a checkup meeting with my employer and university supervisors to discuss progress and gather feedback, ensuring everyone was informed about the project's objectives and timeline. Overall, this week focused on mastering R and laying the groundwork for a functional and informative dashboard through data analysis and initial design drafts.\n\n",
