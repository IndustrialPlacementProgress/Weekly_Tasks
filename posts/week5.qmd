This week, I enhanced the analysis of bird species predictions by creating a diagnostic histogram to visualise the distribution of confidence scores. The histogram revealed a high count of detections with confidence scores ranging from 0.25 to 1.00, highlighting areas for potential improvement. I also analysed the top and bottom three bird species observed with over 20 detections to determine whether common birds had higher detection accuracy than rarer ones. This analysis included calculating average confidence scores and performing ANOVA and Pearson correlation analyses to explore the relationship between detection frequency and confidence scores.

Additionally, I converted my weekly blog notes into a more accessible format using Quarto in RStudio for uploading to GitHub Pages. I attended meetings and conferences to network, stay updated on developments, and receive feedback. I also examined the likelihood of rare bird detections being false positives by analysing confidence scores and recommended an accuracy cut-off in a two-page report.

Lastly, I calculated the average species richness, finding approximately 72 unique species per day, and suggested consistent measurements over time to better assess biodiversity trends.
