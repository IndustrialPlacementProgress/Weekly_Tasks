    "text": "Week 1 Journal\nThe first week predominantly focused on getting acquainted with my colleagues and having an initial meeting to assign my first project. This initial project was centred around a communal food fridge aimed at saving food waste from local supermarkets through donations. My task was to create a Python script that could process a series of images, automatically collected by a setup camera, into a time-lapse video, allowing viewers to see how the food was interacted with over time.\nThis project was a great opportunity to apply my coding skills to develop this Python script. I also learned new skills, such as creating a QR code using Python that linked to the community fridge website, which was a practical implementation of the programming knowledge I gained during my coursework. Setting up a GitHub repository and creating a comprehensive README file helped me understand the importance of documentation and version control in real-world projects. Using DaVinci Resolve to edit the video was also a new experience that enhanced my multimedia skills. Additionally, planning the video content and structure required creativity and project management. Overall, this week blended technical and soft skills development, laying a solid foundation for the tasks ahead."

    "text": "Week 2 Journal\nThe second week began with a briefing on my new task: creating a dashboard from a dataset of food saved by the community fridge. This required data analysis and visualisation to highlight the fridge’s impact on reducing food waste. I created a GitHub repository for managing the Food Waste Data and used RStudio for the first time to perform initial data analysis and visualisations. This allowed me to apply my data analysis skills and learn new R techniques, with the visualisations of the data forming the dashboard’s foundation.\nI planned the dashboard’s structure, selecting key metrics and deciding on the best display methods to convey the information effectively. Drafting the dashboard in RStudio involved experimenting with different layouts to ensure it was informative and visually appealing. Towards the end of the week, we had a checkup meeting with my employer and university supervisors to discuss progress and gather feedback, ensuring everyone was informed on the project’s objectives and timeline. Overall, this week focused on getting to grips with using R and laying the groundwork for a functional and informative dashboard through data analysis and initial design drafts."
