    "text": "Food Bank Video Creator GitHub Repo\nTime Lapse Video\nThe first week predominantly focused on getting acquainted with my colleagues and having an initial meeting to assign my first project. This initial project was centred around a communal food fridge aimed at saving food waste from local supermarkets through donations. My task was to create a Python script that could process a series of images, automatically collected by a setup camera, into a time-lapse video, allowing viewers to see how the food was interacted with over time.\nThis project was a great opportunity to apply my coding skills to develop this Python script. I also learned new skills, such as creating a QR code using Python that linked to the community fridge website, which was a practical implementation of the programming knowledge I gained during my coursework. Setting up a GitHub repository and creating a comprehensive README file helped me understand the importance of documentation and version control in real-world projects. Using DaVinci Resolve to edit the video was also a new experience that enhanced my multimedia skills. Additionally, planning the video content and structure required creativity and project management. Overall, this week blended technical and soft skills development, laying a solid foundation for the tasks ahead."

    "text": "Dashboard Link\nHAU Community Fridge GitHub Repo\nThe second week began with a briefing on my new task: conducting data analysis on a dataset of food saved by the community fridge and creating a dashboard highlighting its impact on reducing food waste. I created a GitHub repository to manage the Food Waste Data and used RStudio for the first time to perform the initial analysis and visualisations. This experience allowed me to apply my data analysis skills and learn new techniques in R, with the visualisations forming the foundation of the dashboard.\nI planned the dashboard’s structure, selecting key metrics and deciding on the best display methods to convey the information effectively. Drafting the dashboard with Quarto in RStudio involved experimenting with different layouts to ensure it was informative and visually appealing. Towards the end of the week, we had a checkup meeting with my employer and university supervisors to discuss progress and gather feedback, ensuring everyone was informed about the project’s objectives and timeline. Overall, this week focused on getting to grips with R and laying the groundwork for a functional and informative dashboard through data analysis and initial design drafts."

    "text": "Dashboard Link\nHAU Community Fridge GitHub Repo\nThis week, I focused on finalising the dashboard. I added an About section and a QR code that links to the community fridge website. I selected and implemented visualisations to display critical information, such as the total number of food items saved, daily averages, and the distribution of food categories. These enhancements ensured that the dashboard effectively communicated the impact of the community fridge. After completing these visualisations, the dashboard was finalised. I also created a comprehensive README file for the dashboard repository using Markdown to ensure proper documentation and usability.\nTowards the end of the week, I had an introductory talk about the main project, BirdNet, an open-source machine-learning framework designed to analyse audio recordings and identify bird species based on their calls. This discussion provided an overview and set the stage for upcoming tasks, including data preparation and analysis of audio data to support conservation efforts. Overall, this week was productive, marking the completion of the dashboard and laying the groundwork for the BirdNet project."

    "text": "My BirdNET GitHub Repo\nThis week, I began exploring BirdNet and familiarizing myself with its libraries and the format of its output data using Google Colab to test the machine-learning framework. I referred to the official BirdNET GitHub page to understand its functionalities better. I also received the first batch of audio recordings to analyze and wrote a script in Google Colab to test run times, interpreting how long it would take to process the audio files. I updated the code to create box plots for run times across various files, which were run three times each to compare how run times differed with multiple runs of the same file.\nI carried out an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine if there was a significant difference in the time BirdNet took to analyze the audio files. The results showed no significant difference in the time taken between different files, with a p-value of 0.80. Additionally, I consolidated all CSV data from all transects into one CSV file, ensuring the correct format and columns. Finally, I tested making graphs with the new CSV data. This week was productive in understanding BirdNet’s processing times and data analysis capabilities, as well as using Google Colab to create understandable and reproducible code that others can read and run from my GitHub repository."
